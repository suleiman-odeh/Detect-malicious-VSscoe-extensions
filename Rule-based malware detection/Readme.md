# Rule-based malware detection

## Description
This technique involves looking for suspicious patterns in the source of vscode extensions.
## rule_based.py
This python code will go through the first 39 thousand extensions and check the state of regular expressions.

## Note
Some extensions may take longer to process. If the python cods takes so long time checking an extension:

1- Stop execution.

2- Modify the python code to skip the problematic extension by adjusting the counter in line 156. For example, if it hangs on the first extension, then modify line 156 with:

if (p < 2):


3- run the code again.


## Steps: 
1- Run rule_based.py

2- This will result a text file with all the suspicious extensions found.
